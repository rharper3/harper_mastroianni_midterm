	<h1>Winter</h1>
	<p>
	Winter is better than summer for many reasons. In my opinion, the best sports take place during the winter season, like snowboarding and hockey. It is also too cold for bugs to be outside. Being outside is much more enjoyable when you are not being constatnly annoyed by pests. Lastly, winter is better than summer because of the Christmas season. It is undoubetdly the best holiday, and you get to spend quality time with family and friends.</p>

	<h1>Summer</h1>
	<p>
	Summer is better than winter for many reasons. Who enjoys wearings loads of clothes, not me, in summer you get to go swimming, hiking, and you can do a lot more outside than you typically could in the summer than during winter. 
	<br>
	The christmas season is full of hate and greed, people just want things its rare that the Christmas season is full of cheer and joy, don't get me started on the amount of car accidents that happen every year during the winter season.</p>
