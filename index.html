	<h1>Winter</h1>
	<p>
	Winter is better than summer for many reasons. In my opinion, the best sports take place during the winter season, like snowboarding and hockey. It is also too cold for bugs to be outside. Being outside is much more enjoyable when you are not being constatnly annoyed by pests. Lastly, winter is better than summer because of the Christmas season. It is undoubetdly the best holiday, and you get to spend quality time with family and friends.</p>
